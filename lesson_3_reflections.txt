Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A1: Remote repos allow for other users on github to view and/or collaborate with a particular project(s). 

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2: Remote branches set up on GitHub may be modified by other users. Only desired changes can be saved on local branch by pulling manually vs automatically.
