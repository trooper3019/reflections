Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A: Git log lists the commits saved for the file along with their ids, comments and date/time. Git diff will show the changes the were made between two commits such as the number of lines of code added or deleted between the versions. 

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
